For Financial aid:

I’m a student from India and want to pursue my career in DataEngineering stream. I think it will be beneficial for me to get into a good firm as an intern. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course. 
I live only for my scholarship. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. Receiving this Financial Aid will open for me a new horizons of the world of Coursera courses , 
which in turn will help me in future .Sir we are three brothers and we all are at learning stage and it becomes a lot difficult for the family members to pay the whole amount for all the three of us and if I add up my course it will make even harder for them to pay. 
Sir, I need this course very badly for my CV and for increasing my knowledge about the subject.
